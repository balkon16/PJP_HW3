# Exercise no. 2

Solution for the exercise no. 2 is located in the `src/zad2` package. The aim of the exercise is to create a programme to read
an input stored in a tab-separated file in the `files` directory. The programme produces two output files (stored in the
`output`) directory:
* `ProjektyDuze.txt` (Polish for *large projects*) which contains only projects with three or more programmers,
* `Programisci.txt` (Polish for *programmers*) which contains programmers and projects they are working on.
