returns information whether dates specified in the *YYYY-MM-DD* format are correct or not.

`output`) directory:
* `ProjektyDuze.txt` (Polish for *large projects*) which contains only projects with three or more programmers,
* `Programisci.txt` (Polish for *programmers*) which contains programmers and projects they are working on.
